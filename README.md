# OS Virtual Lab 
This is an Operating System Virtual Lab. You'll be able to see and understand how processes in your computer work here.

# Lab Layout:
This virtual lab consist of three Page Replacement Alogrithms.
1. FIFO (First In First Out) Algorithm.
2. LRU (least Resently Used) Algorithm.
3. Optimal Algorithm.

# Operation:
On opening the site, you will find information about the page replacement algorithms
then you will see the options for all the algorithms.
you can find brief inrtoduction by hovering over the algorithm tile. 
Suppose, you are in the FIFO Page Replacement Algorithm page.

1. Enter data to visualise how it runs.
2. For running, in the 'Reference String' field, enter space-separated integers with commas (example: 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 4)
3. In the 'Frames' field, enter a single integer (example: 3) which will be the number of frames the algorithm takes.
4. Click on 'Submit' button to see the result.
5. Now, you can see the result in the tabular form and also the Pages, Frames, Hits, Faults, Hit Ratio and Miss Ratio data is available.
6. Now you can navigate through the whole lab and implement any algorithm.
